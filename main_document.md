### Core Game Loop

### Theme

#### Nostolgia

The game is about the nostolgia, the mix of using old machines and the parts of
the past that are stored in breaking mediums and/or old incompatible technology
"a sentimental longing or wistful affection for a period in the past."

it's an old game, and you discovered it, you play it and-

#### Time Travel?

The player is able to rewind as a mechanic? but that also is in tension with the 
player's ability to be nostolgic?

#### Emulation?

The player is able to do partial rewinds, of only their position and nothing else?
